## My process
I started installing NextJS with the TailwindCSS setup.
Then, tried to create the default structure without CSS, only the image, title and paragraph.
With that in place, I started to try to Google things like "How to add background with TailwindCSS", "How to add border with TailwindCSS". I kept this process until have an "okish" version.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

With this project I learned:
- Basic tailwind classes
- Next Image usage
- Next Font usage
- Interpolate classes from tailwind and fonts 

### Continued development

I will now check solutions from others to see what else I can improve in the solution to be more like the expected design.
